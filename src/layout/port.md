# Taffy source-port ledger

This ledger is the completion gate for the literal Zig pass. The authoritative
source is `.references/taffy/src`; every Rust source file has one destination
below. A source row is not complete merely because a file exists: every type,
function, method, default, comment, and algorithm phase must be represented.

During the first pass a missing callable is required to fail loudly with
`@panic("unimplemented Taffy port")` or an equivalent compile-time gate. That
prevents a quiet approximation from being mistaken for a port. Once its real
body is written, the failure gate is removed and its Taffy call sites are
covered by tests.

The literal pass keeps Rust naming and phase order where Zig allows it. Rust
traits, operator implementations, lifetimes, and feature gates are recorded
at their exact boundary and translated to explicit Zig interfaces only when
the language has no direct construct.

## Current declaration gates

The inventory is complete at file level. Production layout no longer contains
an unimplemented-function gate. The remaining loud failures are boundary
guards for unsupported value types, invalid serialized values, unconfigured
generic trait adapters, allocation failure, and out-of-range coordinates;
these preserve failure visibility rather than changing layout semantics
silently.

## Completion audit

The rows above are visited structurally, not complete behaviorally. The port
is complete only when the following gates are all closed:

1. no failure-gate panic remains in production layout code;
2. no source row has an unrepresented Rust declaration or default;
3. the Taffy XML/HTML fixture families are executable against the Zig tree;
4. layout outputs match Taffy within the same tolerance and rounding mode;
5. release benchmarks cover the same tree-creation, flex, grid, and mixed
   cases, with capacity differences explicitly reported.
